      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello there, I currently work at Fatboys Deli & Spirits and I make sandwiches! Its quite honestly the most glamorous job in the world. I come home everyday smelling like the entire deli somehow.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from south San Diego, I've lived here my whole life, its a great place to grow up with lovely weather and beaches within an arms reach. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>On my free time I like to read stories and write poetry. When I feel inspired I also make art.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to sell mushrooms in a remote village in a tropically rainy counrty. In this dream I live in a commune and we live off the collective land.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a box under the 805 freeway.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've heard the tales that web developers can work from remote locations. I love coding because it makes sense to my brain and I also love travel. I'm hoping to get the best of both worlds!</p>
